# Vanilla Typescript

This project is purely done in Vanilla JS with Typescript

Package runs using VITE serve.

It is ideal that this will be done in Angular, but for this test. We only use Vanilla JS (Which is hard) and Typescript.

This project aims to test my Typescript skills. Once passed, I'll try to create an Angular for this.

Also, this is mobile responsive as we are using Bootstrap classes.
